# Earthquake Data Visualisation #

Visualisation of earthquake data by means of a Mercator projection.
Data obtained from the US Geological Survey website and the map from MapBox.


Based on Daniel Shiffman's Coding Train video example:

Resources:

* USGS weblink: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
* MapBox weblink: https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#add-new-icon-to-sprite

The project has been amended from the original coding challenge in order to read json data directly
from the USGS website in order to overcome the CORS issue, or having to read data from a locally stored file.
