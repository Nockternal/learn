# Flappy Bird Neuroevolution: Multiple visualisations

This project demonstrates an attempt to solve the Flappy Bird game by means of a neuroevolutionary algorithm. As part of the learning process, individual visualisations are created of the 25 fittest Flappy Birds.

Each Flappy Bird is created with a neural network and the fittest phenotypes are selected by means of a simple genetic algorithm.

Based on Daniel Shiffman's Coding Train video example:
